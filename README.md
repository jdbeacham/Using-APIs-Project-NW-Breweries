## üç∫ Breweries of the Northwest Corner
### A code project in PHP showcasing the use of APIs

Code (:elephant:) for a project where I use APIs to help people locate breweries near them in the Northwest (Idaho, Oregon, Washington).
APIs used: Open Brewery DB, Google location and distance APIs.

Two files are included:
**index.php, code.php**
